##KishoreK's update

Nothing much is changed except a small fix to adopt my workspace. Always refer to the original PutioKit unless you are using my fork of Puttio.

# PutioKit

Simple framework to use Put.io API in your iOS applications, written in Objective-C. Feel free to fork this repo and help me make it better.
